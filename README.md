# Roommate Roulette

Welcome to **Roommate Roulette!** 

## Overview

Roommate Roulette is an application designed to help you find the perfect roommate(s) for your living situation. Whether you're searching for a single roommate or a group, this tool simplifies the process of finding compatible housemates.

## How To Get Started
1. Register as a new account.
2. After registration, login with your credentials.
3. Create your group.
     - FOR BEST RESULTS: create a group where the number of roommates = 3
5. When your group is created, you can invite other people into your group by telling other users the group username and group password that you set up.
6. Now that you and your roommates are in the group, start searching for your future roommates!
   - Suggested List of Groups takes into account the number of roommates you are looking for, budget, radius, and other applied filters
7. When you find someone who matches what your group is looking for, you may match with them
   - Click on add match, this will add the group to your pending matches 
8. If they match with you back, contact info is released between the 2 groups and you are able to message each other onsite.
   - When the other group has also matched with you, you will be able to see the group be removed from suggested matches and added to your matches.
9. In Matches you can message groups in a group message system, create reviews for the group, and unmatch the group
10. The settings page is where users can change crucial information about their account, and the admin of the group can also access the group settings page to change group information.
11. Make sure to log out before logging back in as a seperate user
